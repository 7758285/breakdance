## What is breakdance?

Breakdance is a node.js library for converting HTML to markdown.

**What's different about breakdance?**

Breakdance uses [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) to parse HTML, and [snapdragon](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/snapdragon) for rendering, which provides granular control over the entire conversion process in a way that is easy to understand, reason about, and [customize](https://breakdance.io/plugins.html).

**Why would I use breakdance?**

* Migrate HTML blog posts to markdown
* Convert wiki pages to markdown
* Convert HTML documentation to markdown
* Convert HTML presentations or slide decks to markdown

## Quickstart

Breakdance is a node.js application, you can download it from [npm](npmjs.com) with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install breakdance
```

Then add the following code to `example.js`, and run `$ node example` to see the generated output:

```js
var breakdance = require('breakdance');
console.log(breakdance('<strong>The freaks come out at night!</strong>'));
//=> '**The freaks come out at night!**'
```

Additional documentation can be found at [breakdance.io](https://breakdance.io).

## Highlights

**Generates well-formatted markdown**

* Comprehensive [HTML tag coverage](lib/compilers.js).
* Granular control over every HTML element and attributes
* Even **converts HTML tables** to markdown!

**Extremely pluggable**

Every part of the conversion is customizable:

* [options](https://breakdance.io/plugins.html) are available for customizing output if you don't like the defaults
* [plugins](https://breakdance.io/plugins.html) are easy to write if you need to change how any element is rendered.

**Built upon solid libraries**

* Uses [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) for fast, efficient and reliable HTML parsing.
* Uses [snapdragon](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/snapdragon) for powerful, pluggable and easy-to-understand rendering

## Examples

Most of the other markdown-to-HTML converters struggle with tables. Breakdance has solid support for well-formed tables, and even some sub-optimal tables. Here are a few examples:

**Tables**

The following HTML table:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Heading 1</th>
      <th>Heading 2</th>
      <th>Heading 3</th>
      <th>Heading 4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Would render to the following markdown:

```html
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 | Heading 4 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
```

See [the documentation](https://breakdance.io/examples.html) for more examples.
