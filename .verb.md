## API
{%= apidocs('breakdance.js') %}

## Highlights

* Generates well-formatted markdown
* Easy to customize: uses [cheerio][] for parsing HTML, and [snapdragon][] for rendering markdown, which makes {%= name %} easy to customize and extend
* Even converts HTML tables to markdown! (nested tables are still output as HTML, since markdown doesn't support nested tables)
* Comprehensive HTML tag coverage. [Renderers](lib/renderers.js) are easy to understand, implement and customize. 
* Created by [jonschlinkert]({%= author.url %}), creator of [assemble][], [remarkable][], and [micromatch][]

Please create [an issue](../../issues/new) if you have a request, find a bug or have suggestions! thanks!

**Edge cases**

There will always be edge cases, the good news is that {%= name %} makes it really easy to implement options or change how any element is rendered. Please create [an issue](../../issues/new) to let us know if you find something that doesn't seem right.

See [docs/edge-cases.md](docs/edge-cases.md) for more documentation about edge cases.


## Getting started

```js
var {%= name %} = require('{%= name %}');
{%= name %}(htmlString[, options]);
```

## Examples

{%= name %} has fairly extensive table support. Below are a few examples (see [the docs]() for more extensive examples):

**Tables**

The following HTML table:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Heading 1</th>
      <th>Heading 2</th>
      <th>Heading 3</th>
      <th>Heading 4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Would render to the following markdown:

```html
| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 | Heading 4 | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
```

And an HTML table with a `<caption>` and aligned columns, like this:

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    This is an example table, and this is its caption to describe the contents.
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Table heading</th>
      <th align="right">Table heading</th>
      <th align="center">Table heading</th>
      <th align="left">Table heading</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
      <td>Table cell</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Would be converted to the following markdown:

```html
<caption>This is an example table, and this is its caption to describe the contents.</caption>
| Table heading | Table heading | Table heading | Table heading | 
| --- | ---: | :---: | :--- | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
| Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | Table cell | 
```

{% console.log(obj) %}
