**Hacking on breakdance**

Override any defaults, or add support for custom elements, attributes or options.
For example, you can control how _any HTML element_ is converted to markdown, or even how a certain element _with specific attributes_ is converted. You can override built-in renderers, create custom renderers _for custom HTML tags_, or create plugins that "bundle" together your commonly used customizations or preferences.
